# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- Start with the basics of each individual part and get basic versions working before trying to make it more complicated
- try to thoroughly research the options for solutions before jumping to solve a problem

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Yes, i managed to get the necessary parts of the game done and also got to some of the nice to haves

## The hardest part?
- keeping the code organized in a way where everything worked efficiently
- maintaining motivation to start on a problem when i know that im going to find a better way to solve it soon

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- nope, unless you count the design but im a programmer not an artist
