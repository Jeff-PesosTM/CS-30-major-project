# Beta-Testing

## Non-programmer's advice:
- Costs of the towers should be included with the buttons
- Map is bland, same with characters

## Programmer's advice:
- Give the towers shots a bit of lead to make the shots hit more frequently
- make the start and end more clear

## My known bugs:
- Turret sprite doesnt aim where it shoots
